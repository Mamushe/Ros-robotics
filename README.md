For the last problem(4th question) i changed the gazebo::transport::NodePtr to ros::NodeHandle n that is why there is two solutions which are inside arm_gazebo package /src and /script for the 4th question.

For the third question it is inside /script named JointAnglePublisher.cpp
And solution for question one is inside question_one folder
